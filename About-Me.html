												<h2> About Me</h2>
											</header>

											<p>My name is Georgia Bywater I am studying my Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Secondary Education (Design Innovation) at
												Australian Catholic University, Strathfield.</p>
												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/thegirls.png" alt="" /></span>

											<h2>More About Me</h2>
											<p>Although I have chosen teaching as my vocation, there are many hobbies that I involve myself in that keep me going. These interests might have initially sparked my interest to go into teaching, or shape the way I can bring real-world experiences into my classroom. 
											</p>

											<h3> Adventuring</h3>
											<p>

												On the weekends and holidays I love going camping with my mates. We go on overnight hikes, or 4WD to camping spots along the coast or high country. These activities keep me connected with nature and build my appreciation for the land we live in. Escaping into nature keeps me sane, allowing me to escape from city life. These outdoor activities can be brought into the cl;assroom through discussing sustainability and resourcefulness, also how nature can be a source of inspiration. 
											</p>

											
											<h3> My Creative Side</h3>
											<p>

												I've always been interested in anything art related, both my grandmas were very artistic and creative, in which sparks of interest started at an early age. Anything that is crafted based I will get involved in, aiming to learn new skills and build upon my existing knowledge. I love working with textiles and natural fibers to create artworks from creating garments, arranging flowers, natural dying or needle-work. I believe all students will gravitate to one aspect of art, and I want to provide them with creative freedom in my classes in which they feel comfortable to express their individuality through artform of wood, metal, textiles, food, painting, drawings and more. </p>

											<h3>Why TAS Teaching?</h3>
											<p>I chose to pursue a career in teaching TAS because I have always had a passion for working with young people. Thereâ€™s something incredibly rewarding about helping students discover and nurture their creativity and potential. I find joy in guiding them through the design process, watching their ideas come to life, and seeing their confidence grow as they develop new skills.
													<br>
													<br>
												TAS offers a unique blend of hands-on learning and creative exploration, which I find particularly exciting. The design aspects of the curriculum allow students to think critically and innovatively, preparing them for the challenges of the future. My goal as a teacher is to inspire my students to think outside the box, embrace their creativity, and realize that they have the power to make a difference through their designs.</p>
